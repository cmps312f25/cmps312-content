/*
  Exhaustive Pattern Matching: ensures that all possible payment types 
  are handled in the switch expression.
  - Dart compiler knows that PaymentMethod has exactly three possible types:
   CreditCard, PayPal, and BankTransfer because itâ€™s a sealed class. 
   This allows the switch expression to be exhaustive.
  - sealed class that can only be extended by classes defined 
    in the same library.
  - This guarantees that no case is left unhandled, making the code 
    more reliable.
  - In the switch we use a pattern to extract the relevant field 
    (cardNumber, email, or bankAccount) and process the payment accordingly.
